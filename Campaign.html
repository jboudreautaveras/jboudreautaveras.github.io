  <h3>Limbo Takes Hollywood</h3> 
  <h4>The Campaign</h4>
</div>

<p>The video transcribed:</p>
<p>Get Limbo to Hollywood! This cat needs your help…</p>
<p>Limbo is a very typical, happy-go-lucky kitten. He likes to jump, play, and get into trouble.</p>
<p>There is one thing, however, that makes this little guy special. He recently went viral on Instagram, amassing around thirty-five (35) followers in just over three (3) months! Now, he’s looking to get to Hollywood and he needs your help!</p>
<p>He is trying to move and break out in the industry. In the description box below, there will be a PayPal link to donate to Limbo. His goal is ten thousand (10,000) dollars. Backers will receive awards based on the amount donated.</p>

<ul>
	<li>$1 will get you a Like from Limbo</li>
	<li>$5 will get you a Follow from Limbo</li>
	<li>$10 will get you a Direct Message from Limbo</li>
	<li>$50 will get you a Paw Print from Limbo</li>
	<li>$100 will get you an Exclusive Meet + Greet with Limbo</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if every one of his followers only donates one (1) dollar, that would still be more than he started with. Any little bit helps.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
