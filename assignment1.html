    Unfortunately, it's just the tips.<br>
    I call her broccoli head and love making fun of her for it, so I decided to dye her whole head green.<br>
    I chose the colour, added a layer mask, and used black to remove all the green from the unwanted areas</p></td>

    So for my black and white photo, I decided I just wanted to colour her dress and eyes because they're the best parts of the photo.<br> 
    I used the same method as I did for the Broccoli Head photo (3), which was probably the issue.<br>
    The masks make the photos darker, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without it.</p></td>
