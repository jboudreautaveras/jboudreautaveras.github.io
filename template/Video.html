      <h3 class="w3-padding-32">Limbo Takes Hollywood</h3>

<p class="w3-text-grey">
My video to raise Limbo ten thousand dollars to get him to Hollywood has a few effects used. None that were too complicated, save for the background for the credits. The entire video was loosely based on AJ+ videos found on Facebook, in a playful manner.<br>
The first thing I did in the video was freeze-frame Limbo’s face mid-meow, put a title (“Soft Bar – Black”) over it, and add a sound effect (“Dramatic Accent 01”). The video then has a transition (“Page Curl Right”) into another clip, where music in the background (“Jaracanda”) starts playing, as I didn’t really have proper audio for it. Fundraising campaigns – especially for animals – usually do better if the viewer can read what’s happening and pause at appropriate spots while watching an animal be, well, an animal. This is the reason why I used AJ+ videos as a template and made a visual campaign, using text throughout the video and highlighting important words as a summary.<br>
As the video continues, there are more transitions (i.e. “Doorway” and “Cross Dissolve”), and then I started using photos of Limbo to capture viewers more. Since the photos didn’t fit the full screen, I used “Ken Burns” effect while cropping to make it more dramatic.<br>
Unfortunately, to make the video longer and for a bit of a change, I screen recorded my phone and liked someone’s photo, followed Limbo’s owner’s Instagram account, and direct messaged him, which led to some pillar boxing. For the aesthetic.<br>
Since I could not visually represent Limbo giving someone one of his paw prints or having a Meet and Greet, I put a clip of him trying to chew on a dog crate in with text about the pledges over it. He sits on the armrest of the couch, and I split that clip to add an effect to the video itself, “Vignette”. I also used slow motion to make it more dramatic and cat-like and royal.<br>
Throughout the rest of the video, there are transitions (“Slide Right”, “Slide Left”, “Mosaic” and “Cross Blur”), titles (“Lower”, “Upper”, “Lower Third”), and the music continues in the background. The final clip of the campaign has no music, but the original audio of a younger Limbo meowing. There is also a title on that clip, just saying “Thank you”, then the clip using “Fade to Black” to transition out of.<br>
I used iMovie for most of the video, except for the background for the credits. I used HitFilm to make a “glitch effect” that I was going to use as a transition, but it didn’t really work too well, so I just figured I would use it for the credits, rather than toss the whole thing.<br>
In the end, there is a clip my friend sent me of Limbo on Snapchat. Her flash is on and he stares directly into the camera, so I freeze-framed that as well, putting a dramatic sound effect in the back and using “Ken Burns” to zoom into his face. The freeze-frame lifts and he just goes back to doing cat stuff. It’s like a “behind the scenes”.</p></p>
