      <p>I cut the racoon from the original photo, and pasted her in a stock photo I found on Google.<br> 
    Then, I turned down the racoon's opacity to give her a bluer hue, so she looked more like she was under water.</p>

      <p>From 3 photos I took in November last year, trying to get a good photo of the sky.<br>
    I layered the three on top of each other and adjusted the opacity for each, trying to get the image of the person to come through enough.</p>

      <p>My ex-girlfriend recently tried to dye her hair blue, but it ended up green.<br>
    Unfortunately, it's just the tips.<br>
    I call her broccoli head and love making fun of her for it, so I decided to dye her whole head green.<br>
    I chose the colour, added a layer mask, and used black to remove all the green from the unwanted areas</p>

      <p>A meme my friends and I use from first year, I decided to try and turn it into a happier meme.<br>
    It just got scarier.<br>
    I used the cage effect just to pull up the sides of her mouth, then went around the area of her entire mouth to hopefully try and make it a little more fluid.<br>
    It didn't work.</p>

      <p>Instead of a head swap, I just took a head from a different photo using the lasso tool.<br>
        I pasted it on my friend's to make it seem like there was a Limbo (cat) and a Big Limbo.</p>

      <p>Our Don last year got a little bit annoyed at us always taking photos of him (sorry Auzzy), so I decided to edit him out of this one.<br> 
    I just copied and pasted parts of the background onto him until he was gone, using the lasso tool.</p>

      <p>Preface: I tried my best to lighten it, it didn't work...<br>
    So for my black and white photo, I decided I just wanted to colour her dress and eyes because they're the best parts of the photo.<br> 
    I used the same method as I did for the Broccoli Head photo (3), which was probably the issue.<br>
    The masks make the photos darker, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without it.</p>

    Used the same methods as from number 2, layering and adjusting opacity.</p>
